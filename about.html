            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
              As a child, my father would always take out his cameras during
              family gatherings, vacations, or milestone events with the intent
              of preserving memory. When I picked up the camera for the first
              time, it wasn’t with intention or outcome in mind but only
              curiosity and play. Now, I photograph to understand. I am drawn to
              relationships: hands interacting with objects, bodies navigating
              space, and the quiet choreography of everyday life. I also love
              exploring color—how it shapes emotion, highlights detail, and
              shapes story. This portfolio is my way of sharing that work. On
              this site, I have collections of my favorite photographs that I
              have taken and organized into different galleries.
            </p>

              In the future, I hope to explore more with film photography. I
              have tried it in the past, but often received photos that were too
              dark or overexposed. For now, I am focused on my digital
              photography skills.
            </p>

              My current camera rotation includes a Fujifilm X-T50 and a Canon
              PowerShot SD1100 IS Digital ELPH.
